# MyCodePrograms - My Development Journey 🚩


Welcome to **MyCodePrograms**, a comprehensive collection 🗃️ of basic programs and projects that I've developed throughout my programming journey. This repository serves as a testament to my growth as a developer 🧑‍💻, showcasing everything from simple "Hello World" programs to more complex beginner and intermediate level projects I have developed. 💻

## Why I Created This Repository? 🤔

<img align="right" alt="Coding" width="400" src="./readme res/pc.gif">

I have created and maintained this repository to keep track 🧾 of my Development Journey with my Experiences, 📸 Projects and much more. These programs help me remember my past Experiences. Also they remind me about the Days when I was Newbie to Coding and had very much curiosity to explore 🚵 it deeply. The Curiosity still exists within and hence, I am still working on my skills and improving them day-by-day. 📉

## Things about this Repository you should Know 🔖

<img align="left" alt="Coding" width="400" src="./readme res/branching.gif">

I have separated different languages using different Branches ⛓️🌍 in this Repository, I know this is not the best practice but still, if you want to dive into any perticular language and see programs in it, then consider changing the branch to that Language. 🪢

<br>

## More About The Journey 📔

The Journey started in 10th when I was exploring How Softwares work? ⌨️🖱️ How Games are made? 🎮...and I found C#. I started learning it without any prior knowledge of computer science, programming or any other related thing. Because of this I tried to watch tutorials but haven't learned anything special. Later I discovered Python. Which excited me and felt really easy to learn. That is when my actual Coding Journey begin. 🎯

<br>

## Diving into the Journey 🏄‍♂️

### 1. Python

All the programs I written during learning Python are included in Python Branch of this Repository also the main (legend) Branch included it as a Folder. 📂 Some of them include [Chrome Dino Automate](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/python/Python/Basic%20Python%20Programming/cromeDinoAutoMate.py), 🦖 [A try to find Greatest Prime Number](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/python/Python/Basic%20Python%20Programming/Finding_the_greatest_prime_number.py), 3️⃣ [Pythagorean Triplets](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/python/Python/Basic%20Python%20Programming/PythagorianTriplets.py), 📐 [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/python/Python/Basic%20Python%20Programming/TicTacToe.py), ✖️ etc.
During the Python Journey, I have also explored [Pygame](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/tree/python/Python/Pygame%20Basic%20to%20Advanced), [OOPs](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/tree/python/Python/Advanced%20Python%20Programming/Static%20Programming%20In%20Python/Object%20Oriented%20Programming%20-%20OOPs), etc

### 2. C / C++

In the learning time of C & C++. I got knowledge about how low level memory management works? 📭🔡 Why Data Structures are important? 📊
In this time I developed programs for [Tic Tac Toe](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/c/C/Basic%20Programming/TicTacToe.c), ✖️ [Prime Number Finder](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/c/C/Basic%20Programming/finding_the_largest_prime_number.c), 3️⃣ [Rock Paper Scissors](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/c/C/Basic%20Programming/New%20Beggining/Rock_Paper_Scissors.c), ✂️ [Travel Agency System](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/c/C/Basic%20Programming/New%20Beggining/Travel_Agency.c), 🚄 etc in C and [OOPs](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/tree/cpp/C%2B%2B/New%20Beginning/OOPS%20-%20C%2B%2B), [STL](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/tree/cpp/C%2B%2B/New%20Beginning/Standard%20Template%20Library), etc. in C++.

### 3. Java

While learning Java, I understood [Exception Handling](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/java/Java/My%20Programs/src/Basic_Code/Source/Exception_Handling.java), [Multithreading](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/java/Java/My%20Programs/src/Basic_Code/Source/MultiThreading.java), [Generics](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/blob/java/Java/My%20Programs/src/Basic_Code/Source/Generics.java), etc. 🎓 I primarily learned Java to start Android Development. 📲

### 4. DSA & DP

I learned DSA using C and tried to Make all Structures in C, which you can find inside [Custom Includable Headers](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/tree/c/C/Custom%20Includable%20Header%20Files). ✒️ Also I tried DSA in C++ & Python.
I learned Dynamic Programming and applied it using [Python](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/tree/python/Python/Advanced%20Python%20Programming/Dynamic%20Programming%20In%20Python)/[C++](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/tree/cpp/C%2B%2B/New%20Beginning/Dynamic%20Programming%20Problems). 📑 These courses taught me how to manage data, store, retrieve and manipulate it efficiently.⏲️ Also I learned basic concepts like Time/Space Complexity, etc. ⌛

### 5. Web Development

When I was learning basics of HTML, CSS and JS. I understood some fundamental UI designing concepts 🖼️ and Styling techniques. 🎨🖌️ I have made some example projects inside [Webdev](https://github.com/YashGames2007/MyCodePrograms/tree/webdev) folder, visit if you want to explore.

### 6. Android Development

I learned Android Development using Java but later switched to Kotlin and Compose. The Android Projects are made in Android Studio 🖥️ and are not part of this repository. 💾 But you can download some of them [using this link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1t1KG3WSNvTN2l73ldb4NvKK2MvaPDcYX?usp=sharing). 🛜
