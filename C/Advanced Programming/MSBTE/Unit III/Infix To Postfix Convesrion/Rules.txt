Infix To Postfix Conversion:

    Terminology:

        (*) Operators ||--*-->>     +, -, *, /, $, Etc.
        (*) Operands  ||--*-->>     X, Y, 5, 9, 67, Etc.

        (*) Infix Expression    ||--*->>    A + B
        (*) Postfix Expression  ||--*-->>    A B +

    Rules:

        |==1=>  Operand Will Directly Go To Postfix.
        |==2=>  Operator Will First Go To Stack And Then To Postfix.  
        |==3=>  Operators Will Go To Postfix According To Priority Rules.
    
    Priority Rules:

        |==1=>  If Operator That Has Higher Priority Than The Current Operator Is Already 
                Present In Stack, Then Push The Higher Priority Operator Into Postfix
                And Operator With Low Priority To Stack.
        
        |==2=>  If Operator That Has Lower Priority Than The Current Operator Is Already 
                Present In Stack, Then Both The Operators Will Remain In Stack.
        
        |==3=>  If Operator Present On Stack And Current Operator Has Equal Priority
                Then Push The Operator Present On Stack To Postfix And Keep The Current
                Operator On Stack. 

        |==4=>  If Current Becomes Empty I.E. Expression Ends Then Push The Remaining 
                Operators Directly Into Postfix.  
        
        |==5=>  If Two or More operators are present on the stack then push them to
                postfix such that the last added operator on stack will go first into
                postfix.
