Selection Sort:

    Algorithm:

        1)  Select the first element of the array.
        2)  compare the selected element with all other elements in the array.
        3)  for every comparison, if any element is smaller than selected 
            element, then these two elements are swapped.
        4)  repeat the same procedure with next positon in the array till 
            the entire array is sorted.
